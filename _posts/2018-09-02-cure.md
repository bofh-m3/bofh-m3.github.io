Monitoring. As many solutions as there are things to monitor. 
Like most people working on most IT-departments, me and my team are faced with a plethora of different sources of alerts and events. 
Email. Slack. Teams. SIEM. SysLogs. EventLogs. RSS. Tickets. 
It's a pain to go through events, and difficult to get an overall feel for the current state of things.
You know the feeling.
How can we make this better?

## The vision
I wanted something simple that could give me the current state of IT at a glance. I wanted RED/YELLOW/GREEN. I wanted the overview to be easily accessible, whenever I wanted/felt like it. I also wanted the possibility to see more details on a specific event. WHEN I wanted. I also wanted anyone on the team to be able to contribute, not just the PowerShell/Python-savvy.
And last, but not least, I wanted to be able to put this up on a wall mounted monitor at each IT department at the company (we have several offices around the Nordics), so everyone could see the status!

## The Design
I previously had built a monitoring system entirely in PowerShell that basically outputted static HTML for consumption in a browser (set to auto refresh). I wanted to keep the good things about that system (easy to modify/extend) but make it more flexible and easier to maintain and less resource intensive. The previous version was an exercise in module-writing and runspaces, so I wanted CURE to be simpler.

## The components
A quick walkthrough of the components in the above design.
#### SYSTEMS
The systems/data sources to monitor.
#### DETECTOR
The function, usually a script, that collects the data from the *system*, analyzes and posts to the *database*.
#### DATABASE
Persistent storage for events and settings.
#### BACK-END
Api and some logic.
#### FRONT-END
JavaScript and CSS.
#### CLIENT
Primarily a browser but possibly something else later.

## The UI
So this is how the UI turned out. I’m very pleased! It’s been running for some months now, and there’s been some minor adjustments, but the solution turned out pretty much exactly as my vision! 
In logged in mode you’re able to click the headline of a detector and get more info (that may contain sensitive information and therefore is tucked away behind a login). In logged out mode you’re only able to see the color of the detectors and a short summery. This mode is truly public and awailable for anyone.
On the top bar you’re able to filter on detectors for a specific area, for example “Azure” or “Helpdesk”.

I plan to make a series of posts on CURE with more details and some learnings.
