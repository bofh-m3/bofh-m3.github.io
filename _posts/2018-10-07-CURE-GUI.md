As described in my previous posts, [Micke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikael-öberg-82520742) took the responsibility of setting up and coding the GUI parts of CURE. In this post I'll try to describe the setup, even though I'm not 100% sure what the hell I'm talking about... But I'll give it a shot!

## Server and App
Micke made some decisions regarding the GUI and went about installing the components needed on a fresh Ubuntu VM, steal what needed to be stolen and code what needed to be coded. Besides PostgreSQL, Nginx and Python 3.6.6 was installed.
He decided to run the GUI as a *Gunicorn* app within a *venv* virtual environment, so also these python modules were installed.

#### Create a user to host and run the app and add it to www-data group (nginx process user):
```
sudo useradd -m cureweb
sudo passwd cureweb
sudo usermod -a -G www-data cureweb
```
#### App folder structure.
In */home/local/cureweb/cure* we find (approximate) this folder structure:

| _Name_           | _Type_   | _Description_                                                 |
|:-----------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| app              | *folder* | The app directory for the CURE GUI app                        |
| migration        | *folder* | Flask-Migrate extension (for SQLAlchemy database migrations ) |
| venv             | *folder* | The *venv* module folder                                      |
| .env             | *file*   | The environment variables and secrets                         |
| config.py        | *file*   | Flask and sql config file                                     |
| requirements.txt | *file*   | Python pip requirements file (?)                              |
| run.py           | *file*   | Starts the app                                                |

If we take a closer look in the *app* folder we find this (approximate) content:

| _Name_      | _Type_   | _Description_                                             |
|:------------|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| static      | *folder* | the static content such as css, fonts, images, javascript |
| templates   | *folder* | the HTML templates                                        |
| __init__.py | *file*   | The app ini file to load SQLAlchemy, Flask etc.           |
| api.py      | *file*   | Used for the "snooze" functionality on a detector         |
| auth.py     | *file*   | For authenticating to LDAP (Active Directory)             |
| forms.py    | *file*   | For defining the Jinja2 flaskwtf form for login           |
| models.py   | *file*   | Data modeling                                             |
| views.py    | *file*   | The routing (this is where the frontend magic happens)    |

And if we look in the *static* folder we find this (approximate) content:

| _Name_ | _Type_   | _Description_                                             |
|:-------|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| css    | *folder* | CSS for icons, menu and browser support. mostly borrowed. |
| fonts  | *folder* | Fonts                                                     |
| img    | *folder* | Images                                                    |

| sound  | *folder* | sound (for audio warning on red alert)                    |

And if we finally peek in the *templates* folder we find this (approximate) content:

| _Name_                | _Type_   | _Description_                                                       |
|:----------------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _detector.html        | *file*   | How all detector square should look-color, snooze, text, links etc. |
| base.html             | *file*   | The base template. Contains menue, js, css etc.                     |

#### Create a service for the app.
In order for the app to run at startup, create a service.
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cure.service
```
With this content:
```
[Unit]
Description=Cure webapp service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=cureweb
Group=www-data
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
WorkingDirectory=/home/local/cureweb/cure
Environment="PATH=/home/local/cureweb/cure/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/local/cureweb/cure/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:cure.sock run:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
The service can then be started and enabled.
```
sudo systemctl start cure
sudo systemctl enable cure
```
#### Configure nginx
With a command like this, an nginx config is made
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/cure
```
And with content similar to this
```
server {
    # listen on port 80 (http)
    listen 80;
    server_name cure.company.xx;
    location / {
        # redirect any requests to the same URL but on https
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
server {
    # listen on port 443 (https)
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name cure.company.xx;

    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers       on;

    # write access and error logs to /var/log
    access_log /var/log/cure_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/cure_error.log;

    location / {
        # forward application requests to the gunicorn server
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/local/cureweb/cure/cure.sock;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    location /static {
        # handle static files directly, without forwarding to the application
        alias /home/local/cureweb/cure/app/static;
        expires 30d;
    }
}
```

## The result
This gif gives an idea of how the landing page will look with different levels of alerts.
![Cure GUI landing page](/assets/images/cure-gui-ani.gif)

When clicking the headline of a detector, you get the details
![Cure GUI detector details](/assets/images/cure-gui-detector-details.png)

And when toggling the headline on the detector details page, you see some details on the detector itself, such as id, heartbeat, environment, status and history.

And when clicking the history link you get an overview of the historical statuses for the specific detector.

**UPDATED ON 2019-05-03**
I just took the time to go through what Micke has been working on, pretty much on his own, on and off during the last 6 months. Many of my assumptions of the GUI was wrong and/or has been changed during this time, so I've updated this post, complete with some images on how it *currently* looks.
