Hello World! 
In this blog I'll write about the everyday life as an IT manager. I'll write about **Automation**, **Monitoring**, **Leadership**, **InfoSec**, **Infrastructure**, **Cloud** and possibly give glimpses into the life of an average [BOFH](http://bofh.bjash.com/).

## Who am I?
An IT pro turned manager with a desire to share some of the stuff I've learned through the years.
A proud father of 2 small kids.

## About this blog
I have attempted to gather some previous posts on another platform into this Github Pages/Jeckyll version. 
I'm trying out Minimal Mistakes theme and learning about all the new and shiny stuff, probably basic stuff for the kids, but new territory for me...
